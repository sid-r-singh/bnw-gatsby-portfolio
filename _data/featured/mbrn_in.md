## Background
During my UG, I was part of the multimedia team. Like any other university, we also have various functions/events hosted in our campus. The multimedia team is entrusted with the responsibility of capturing photos & videos of these events & most importantly ensure that students/faculty get these photos/videos at the end of a semester. Now this becomes a challange given the unique constraints posed by the campus administration. The rules dictate that, no student should be in possesion of flashdrive or HDDs. Thus for taking their memories(photos/videos) the only means left is DVD. Prior to me joining the team, this how the memories were given. For a given program, videos & images were highly compressed to accomodate within the 4.7GB capacity of a DVD. This resulted in significant degradation of video quality. At this point one may question, why not put the photos in one DVD & videos in another, which will barely demand any video compression. The answer is that, the act of procuring 2 DVDs for a single event would simply not be economical for the students & needless to say, there will be reluctance among them to procure these DVDs.
## My proposal
Observing these peculiarities, this is what proposed to the team & it's head. First I convinced them that due to the rapidly evolving standards of the media & production industry, few years from now 1080p/4K will be the de facto standard. So years later when our students look back at their memories, they will be dissastisfied with the resolution/quality of the video. Hence there is a need for us to provide them with Full HD videos with high bitrate .
To achieve this I proposed that, the photos can be uploaded cloud storage (Google drive or Mega.nz) & students be given access to that. 
## My contributions
I designed a website which would serve as a repository of photos of events for years to come.
